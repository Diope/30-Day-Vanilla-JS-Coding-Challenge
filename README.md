# 30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge.

I got inspired by some really nice members over at the Javascript subreddit who suggested to many people to try and create 30 JS projects over the course of 30 days. They don't have to be complex, hell they could be as simple as a hello `insert your name here` app. The main point is to always be coding (ABC), just to measure one's own growth.
